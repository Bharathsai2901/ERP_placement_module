                              In the year 2015, the Government of Andhra Pradesh has given 548 acres of land for setting up the permanent campus. The construction of stage 1 of the permanent campus which caters to 2,500 students, 250 faculty members, and 275 staff members has been completed. Facilities including laboratories, classrooms, hostels, two departmental buildings, and a sports complex are fully operational from July 2022.

They have been going to villages to spread awareness in respect of various government programs such as Pulse Polio Abhiyan, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, etc. The students actively participate in numerous clubs such as adventure, photography, astronomy, music, chess, social outreach, etc. Students have taken up excellent initiatives to set up the sports and cultural events on campus that have helped the students to hone collective responsibility skills and leadership qualities.
